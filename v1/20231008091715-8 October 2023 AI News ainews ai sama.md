Symbotic's systems use robots and AI to pick and pack items more efficiently and accurately than humans can. Walmart is using Symbotic's systems in its own warehouses, and Softbank is helping Symbotic to expand into new markets.Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has warned that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could lead to a "war" between humans and machines. Altman said that AGI could pose a serious threat to humanity if it is not developed carefully.The Japanese government is reportedly planning to propose rules for generative AI to G7 leaders. The rules are unknown but will be based on transparency, accountability, fairness, and respect.Boards should ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical way because AI could lead to job displacement, and it could be used to create harmful or offensive content. Boards should have a plan in place to mitigate the risks of AI.Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, has said that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will come within 10 years which is very optimistic. Son said that AGI will be more intelligent than humans and that it will have a profound impact on society.Factually Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FA RLHF) is a new and promising approach to improving the accuracy and reliability of AI models to train AI models that can overcome hallucinations. FA RLHF uses human feedback to help AI models to learn the difference between real and fake data.
