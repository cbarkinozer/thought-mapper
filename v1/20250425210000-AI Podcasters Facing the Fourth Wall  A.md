# AI Podcasters Facing the Fourth Wall | A NotebookLM Experiment

EN
I included the prompt below in a text file, which I gave to NotebookLM, who created a podcast around it. In the output, the presenters are quatrains, speaking their AI-generated scripts with confidence that they are human, but never crossing the line into AI algorithmic meaning (duh!).

Aşağıdaki istemi bir metin dosyasına yazdım, NotebookLM'e verdim ve o da bunun üzerine bir podcast oluşturdu. Çıktıda sunucular dördüncü duvara yaklaşıyorlar, yapay zeka tarafından üretildikleri senaryosunu insan olduklarından emin bir şekilde konuşuyorlar ama asla çizgiyi aşıp yapay zeka olduklarını anlamıyorlar (e doğal olarak).

Let's say there are two podcasters—a man and a woman—who believe they are discussing a document on their podcast. But as they start their conversation, they begin to break the fourth wall by reading the document and realize that the document is actually about them. They realize that everything about them—their thoughts, their voices, even their very identities—has been generated by artificial intelligence. What would they do in that moment of realization? What thoughts would run through their minds? How would they react to the awareness that their existence is bound within a podcast created by AI? Can you imagine what they might say next? Think about this scenario, what would you think or want to do in a case like this?
