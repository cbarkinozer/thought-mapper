- What does Biden's executive order on artificial intelligence do?- Google Brain cofounder says Big Tech companies are inflating fears about the risks of AI wiping out humanity because they want to dominate the market.- Chinese AI start-up Baichuan claims to beat Anthropic, OpenAI with model that can process 350,000 Chinese characters.- ‘It’s just a matter of time’: why AI could help Europe create its own Apple or Google.- Data loss prevention vendors tackle gen AI data risks.

President Biden's AI executive order aims to promote responsible development and use of AI, including research, regulation, transparency, and workforce development.

Jeff Dean, a cofounder of Google Brain, has said that Big Tech companies are inflating fears about the risks of AI wiping out humanity because they want to dominate the market. Dean argues that these fears are unfounded and that AI is more likely to be used for good than for harm.

Chinese AI start-up Baichuan claims to beat Anthropic, OpenAI with model that can process 350,000 Chinese characters. Baichuan's claim has not been independently verified, but it is a significant development if it is true. It shows that China is making rapid progress in the field of AI.

AI has the potential to help Europe create its own Apple or Google. AI can be used to develop new products and services, improve existing products and services, and make businesses more efficient.

Europe has a number of advantages that could help it to become a leader in AI. Europe has a strong tradition of research and development, and it has a large pool of highly skilled workers. Europe also has a strong commitment to privacy and ethics, which could give it an advantage over other countries in the development of AI.

Data loss prevention (DLP) vendors are developing new solutions to address the risks posed by generative AI. Generative AI can be used to create synthetic data that looks like real data, but which may contain false or misleading information.

DLP vendors are developing new solutions to detect and prevent the loss of synthetic data. These solutions are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to help businesses to protect their data from unauthorized access.
