- Placebo effect shapes how we see AI.

- Spotify spotted prepping a $19.99/mo ‘Superpremium’ service with lossless audio, AI playlists and more.

The BBC is concerned about the potential for OpenAI to be used to spread misinformation and to generate harmful content. However, the BBC is also interested in exploring how AI can be used to improve journalism.

The BBC has laid out a number of principles: transparency, accuracy, fairness, respect.

AI is being used by scammers to create more sophisticated and convincing phone scams. Scammers are using AI to generate synthetic voices that sound like real people. Hiya has reported that the number of AI-powered phone scams has increased by 200% in the past year.

The new ad format is called the X Story Ad. X Story Ads are full-screen ads that appear between stories. X Story Ads can't be reported or blocked because they are served directly to X users by X.

A new study has found that the placebo effect shapes how we see AI. The study found that people who are told that they are interacting with an AI system are more likely to attribute positive qualities to the system, even if the system is not actually performing well.

Spotify is reportedly preparing to launch a new $19.99/mo "Superpremium" service. The new service is expected to offer lossless audio, AI playlists, and other features.
