- AI moves into overworked 911 centers.

- Intel launches AI acceleration program for PC software.

- IBM's brain-inspired chip could be the fastest at running AI yet.

- OpenAI debates when to release its AI-generated image detector.

- An Industry Insider Drives an Open Alternative to Big Techâ€™s A.I.

AI-powered systems are being used in overworked 911 centers to help dispatchers prioritize calls, identify potential threats, and provide support to callers. For example, AI can be used to analyze incoming calls and identify those that are most urgent, or to provide dispatchers with information about the caller's location and the type of emergency. AI can also be used to provide support to callers who are experiencing a mental health crisis or who are in a dangerous situation.Intel has launched a new program to help developers accelerate the adoption of AI in PC software called the "AI Acceleration Program," which provides developers with access to Intel's AI hardware and software tools, as well as training and support.IBM has developed a new chip that is inspired by the human brain called the "TrueNorth" chip, is designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional AI chips and to be able to learn and adapt to new information more quickly.OpenAI  is debating when to release its AI-generated image detector. The detector is able to identify images that have been generated by AI with high accuracy. OpenAI is concerned about the potential for its AI-generated image detector to be used to create fake news, deepfakes and track people's activity.Professor in Berkeley and cofounder David Patterson is concerned about the dominance of Big Tech companies in the AI market. He believes that Big Tech companies are using their AI power to stifle competition and innovation. Patterson is working on an open-source AI platform called "Leaf." Leaf is designed to be more accessible and affordable than Big Tech's AI platforms.
