First artificial intelligence supermarket in metro Atlanta is now officially open. The store, called the "AI Grocery," is powered by Amazon's Just Walk Out technology. This technology uses cameras and sensors to track customers' movements and purchases, allowing them to checkout without having to scan any items or use a cashier.

An AI firm called Clearview AI has been harvesting billions of photos from the internet without consent. The company has been using these photos to train its facial recognition software.

Britain is powerless to act against Clearview AI's practice of harvesting photos without consent. This is because Clearview AI is not based in the United Kingdom.

Amazon is testing a humanoid robot in its warehouses as part of a push to automate operations. The Proteus robot developed by Agility Robotics is designed to work alongside human employees in warehouses. The robot can lift and move objects, as well as pick and pack items. Amazon is testing the Proteus robot in a small number of warehouses.

YouTube is developing an AI tool that can help creators sound like famous musicians. The tool, called the "Vocal Effects" tool, uses machine learning to analyze the vocal characteristics of famous musicians and then apply those characteristics to the creator's voice.

Meta has made progress towards developing an AI system that can decode images from brain activity. The system, called the "Brain-Computer Interface" system, uses machine learning to analyze brain scans and identify the images that the person is seeing.

Tech giants Foxconn and Nvidia are teaming up to develop "AI factories." AI factories are factories that use AI to automate production and improve efficiency.
