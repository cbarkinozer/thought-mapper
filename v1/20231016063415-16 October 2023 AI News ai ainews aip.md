A pastor in Texas who used AI to generate a sermon and other parts of a church service said he would not do it again because it did not have the "human element".

Gary Gensler, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has urged regulators to tame the risks of AI to financial stability. Gensler said that AI could pose a number of risks to the financial system, including the risk of market manipulation and the risk of systemic collapse.

OpenAI has quietly changed its core values. The company has removed the values of "thoughtful" and "audacious" from its list of core values.

The Nigerian government has announced that it will be supporting AI initiatives with $290,000 in grants. The grants will be awarded to startups and individuals who are developing AI solutions to address some of Nigeria's most pressing challenges, such as poverty, education, and healthcare.

Meta's AI Personas are a new type of AI that can be used to create realistic and engaging chat experiences. AI Personas are trained on large datasets of text and code, and they can be used to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way.

The United States is planning to tighten curbs on China's access to advanced chip technology. The new restrictions are designed to prevent China from developing its own semiconductor industry and from using advanced chip technology for military purposes.
