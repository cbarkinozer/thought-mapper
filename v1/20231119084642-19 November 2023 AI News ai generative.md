Artificial intelligence can help businesses build better key performance indicators by providing insights into data that would be difficult or impossible to obtain manually. For example, AI can be used to track customer behavior, analyze sales data, and identify trends in the market. 

Quantum computers are a new type of computer that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize machine learning. Quantum computers can be used to train machine-learning models on larger and more complex datasets than is possible with traditional computers. 

Germany, France, and Italy have reached an agreement on future AI regulation. The agreement includes a number of principles, such as the need for AI to be transparent, accountable, and unbiased. The agreement also calls for the establishment of a new EU body to oversee AI regulation.

Sam Altman's ouster as CEO of OpenAI has exposed a growing rift in the AI industry. Altman is a proponent of "open AI," which means that AI research should be freely available to everyone. However, there is a growing movement within the AI industry that believes that AI should be developed and controlled by a small number of companies. Altman's ouster is seen as a victory for this movement.

Facebook-parent Meta has broken up its Responsible AI team. The team was responsible for developing policies and guidelines for the development and use of AI at Meta. The breakup of the team has been criticized by some who believe that it will make it more difficult for Meta to develop responsible AI.
