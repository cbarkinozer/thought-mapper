Nvidia is already seeing strong demand for the H200, and the company is struggling to keep up with production.

Microsoft has announced a new feature for its Office suite that uses AI to make meetings less painful. The feature, called Meeting Notes, automatically takes notes of meetings and then summarizes them for participants. Meeting Notes also uses AI to identify key insights from meetings and share them with participants. Microsoft is hoping that Meeting Notes will help to make meetings more productive and less stressful.

WhatsApp has added a new feature that lets users chat with Meta AI. The feature, called Meta Assistant, is a chatbot that can be used to answer questions, provide information, and perform tasks. Meta Assistant is still in its early stages of development, but it is already able to perform a variety of tasks, such as booking restaurants and making travel arrangements.
