- Early OpenAI Investor: Most AI Firms Won’t Make Money.


- What AI skills Gen Z can focus on to stand out among peers.

- Biden to sign executive order expanding capabilities for government to monitor AI risks.

- Exclusive: G7 to agree AI code of conduct for companies.

- Snapdragon 8 Gen 3’s on-device AI demands the question of why Google Tensor exists.

Sam Altman, an early investor in OpenAI, has predicted that most AI firms will not make money. Altman believes that the AI market is too competitive and that it will be difficult for most firms to differentiate themselves.

Gen Z is the first generation to grow up with AI. This gives Gen Z a unique opportunity to develop the skills that will be in demand in the future AI workforce. Gen Z can learn AI by focusing on machine learning, data science, software development, and communication.

US President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order that will expand the government's capabilities to monitor AI risks. The executive order will also create a new AI risk mitigation office.

The Group of Seven (G7) is expected to agree on a code of conduct for AI companies. The code of conduct will provide guidelines for the development and use of AI.

The G7's code of conduct is a significant development. It is the first time that the G7 has agreed on a set of principles for the use of AI. The code of conduct is expected to help to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical way.


The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm's latest flagship mobile processor, has been praised for its powerful on-device AI capabilities. This raises the question of why Google Tensor, Google's custom-designed mobile processor, exists. Google Tensor is designed to be particularly well-suited for AI workloads. However, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3's on-device AI capabilities are very close to those of Google Tensor.
