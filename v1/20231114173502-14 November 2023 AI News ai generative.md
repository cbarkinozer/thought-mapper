- YouTube to offer option to flag AI-generated songs that mimic artistsâ€™ voices. 

 - Popular AI platform introduces rewards system to encourage deepfakes of real people. 

- We need hard laws on military use of AI.

- White faces generated by AI are more convincing than photos, finds survey.

- AI could predict heart attack risk up to 10 years in the future, finds Oxford study . 

- Google starts trial for generative AI search engine in Singapore.

YouTube is considering adding a  feature that would allow users to flag songs that they believe were generated by AI and that mimic the voices of real artists. This is in response to the growing concern about the use of AI to create fake music that could be used to deceive or mislead listeners.

A new rewards system that has been introduced by a popular AI platform. This system is designed to encourage users to create deepfakes of real people. Deepfakes are videos or audio recordings that have been manipulated using AI to make it appear as if someone is saying or doing something that they did not actually say or do. 

AI is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and there is a risk that it could be used to develop autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention. 

A new survey has found that people are more likely to believe that photos of White people generated by AI are real than photos of people of color generated by AI. This is a worrying finding, as it suggests that AI could be used to create fake news or propaganda that is more likely to be believed by certain groups of people.

A new study by researchers at the University of Oxford has found that AI could be used to predict heart attack risk up to 10 years in the future. This is a significant breakthrough, as it could help to identify people who are at risk of a heart attack early on so that they can take steps to prevent it.

A new trial that Google has started for a generative AI search engine in Singapore. This search engine uses AI to generate new content based on the user's search query. This is a new approach to search that could revolutionize the way we find information online.
