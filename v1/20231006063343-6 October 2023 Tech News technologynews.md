Wearable AI is a growing field, with companies racing to develop new devices that can integrate AI into our daily lives. Some of the most common wearable AI devices include smartwatches, fitness trackers, and augmented reality glasses.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a new AI approach that has resulted in the creation of a more athletically intelligent robotic dog  called SpotMini that is able to learn new tricks and adapt to new environments more quickly than previous robotic dogs.

Google is reportedly planning to bring its Bard AI to Galaxy devices soon. This would allow Galaxy users to interact with Bard using their voice.

Tiny language models (TLMs) are a new type of AI model that is smaller and faster than traditional language models. TLMs are trained on the same data as traditional language models, but they are designed to be more efficient and to be able to run on devices with limited resources.

Meta is reportedly paying creators millions of dollars to develop AI chatbots that can be used on its platforms. Meta is hoping that the AI chatbots will help to keep users engaged and to attract new users.

Apple reportedly considered ditching Google as the default search engine in Safari's private mode. Apple was reportedly concerned about Google's data collection practices and wanted to offer its users a more privacy-focused search experience.

Microsoft's Bing AI image generator is trying to block prompts that contain the words "twin towers." The company is doing this in an effort to prevent the generator from being used to create harmful or offensive content.
