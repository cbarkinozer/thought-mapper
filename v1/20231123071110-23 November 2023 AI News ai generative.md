Researchers at the Santa Barbara (UCSB) have developed an AI model that can use satellite images to detect plastic in oceans. The model was able to identify plastic with an accuracy of over 80%. This is a significant breakthrough, as it could be used to track the movement of plastic in the oceans and to identify areas where it is concentrated. 

The rise of generative AI is changing the cybersecurity landscape. Generative AI can be used to create new malware and to automate attacks. This means that cybersecurity professionals need to have the skills to keep up with the latest threats. 

CompVis, the AI startup behind Stable Diffusion, is now testing generative video. Generative video is a type of AI that can create new videos. Generative video could be used for a variety of applications, such as creating training videos, producing marketing materials, and generating entertainment content.

A growing number of tech execs are concerned about the power that Big Tech companies have over artificial intelligence (AI). They believe that Big Tech companies are using AI to gain an unfair advantage over other companies and that this is stifling innovation. These concerns are being raised at a time when Big Tech companies are increasingly investing in AI. 

Google’s Bard AI chatbot can now answer questions about YouTube videos. This is a significant breakthrough, as it could be used to improve the YouTube experience for users. For example, Bard could be used to help users find videos that are relevant to their interests or to answer questions about a video that they are watching.
