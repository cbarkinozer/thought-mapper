The PC market is recovering after a slowdown in 2022, thanks to strong demand from businesses and consumers. Intel and AMD, the two leading chipmakers, are both touting the potential of AI-powered PCs, which they believe will be a key driver of growth in the coming years.

Vice President Kamala Harris has warned that the "existential threats" of artificial intelligence are already here. She has called for the US government to take a leading role in developing and regulating AI, to ensure that it is used for good and not for harm.

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, but it is not the only one. Llama, a large language model developed by Google AI, is gaining traction in the AI community due to its open source nature.

Machine learning engineer is the most in-demand AI job of 2023, according to a recent report. Machine learning engineers build and maintain machine learning models, which are used in a wide range of applications, such as product recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.

The meeting was held in secret, and the UK government has refused to say why it did not acknowledge China's participation.
