- Microsoft CEO Testifies on AI, Google Search.- Spotify Is Playing Around With AI-Generated Playlists From a Prompt.- Nvidiaâ€™s RTX 3060 is officially the most popular GPU according to Steam survey.- Apple Watch Ultra 2 users complain that display is too dim in low light.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified in a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing Google of using its dominance in search to stifle competition. Nadella said that Google's business practices make it difficult for Microsoft and other companies to compete in the search market.  If Microsoft is successful, it could have a major impact on the way Google operates its search business.

Spotify is testing a new feature that would allow users to generate playlists based on a prompt.  To use the feature, users would simply type in a prompt, such as "new music I like" or "songs to relax to." Spotify would then generate a playlist based on the prompt. This could help users to discover new music and to create playlists that are tailored to their specific needs.

Nvidia's RTX 3060 is now the most popular GPU according to the latest Steam survey. The RTX 3060 is a mid-range GPU that offers good performance for a reasonable price.

Some users of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 have complained that the display is too dim in low light. Users have reported that they have to turn up the brightness to the maximum setting in order to see the display in low light.
