# Explaining Abstract Classes and Interfaces Using Java

Extending, implementing, abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, overriding, overloading terms in Java are explained.

Note: Fields of the classes should be private. Only constructors, getters and setters can reach these fields. This is called encapsulation. Except interface's fields, they must be public and interfaces do not have constructors.
