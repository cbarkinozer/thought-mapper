Google is developing new AI-powered video ads that will be more personalized and engaging than traditional video ads. 

Analysts predict that "overhyped" generative AI will get a "cold shower" in 2024  because the expectations for generative AI are too high.

A new study found that AI can be used to identify changes in the brain that occur as people age. The study also found that AI can be used to predict how a person's brain will age in the future.

A new article in the magazine "The Atlantic" argues that AI is a "money pit" that is not yet paying off. The article argues that AI is still in its early stages of development and that it is not yet able to deliver on its promises.

Cleanlab, a company that develops tools to help clean and label AI data, has raised $25 million in funding. The company's tools are designed to help AI developers to create more accurate and reliable AI models.

Tesla's Dojo supercomputer is designed to help Tesla to train and deploy AI models for its self-driving cars and other products.

ChatGPT and other AI tools could disrupt scientific publishing by making it easier and faster to write and publish scientific papers. AI tools could also help to improve the quality of scientific papers by identifying errors and suggesting improvements.

AMD is acquiring Nod.ai to help AMD to improve its AI software offerings and to compete more effectively with other tech companies in the AI market.

Adobe has created a new symbol to help users to identify and credit AI-generated content.
