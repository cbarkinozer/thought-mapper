-  Elon Musk launches AI chatbot 'Grok’ — says it can outperform ChatGPT .- Odyssey Ai-One: Artificial Intelligence comes to putters.- 7-Eleven Japan to use generative AI to speed production planning.- Tech giants pour billions into cloud capacity in AI push.- China's AI Analog Chip Claimed To Be 3000X Faster Than Nvidia's A100 GPU. - The Taiwanese American cousins going head-to-head in the global AI race.

Grok is a new AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's company OpenAI. Musk claims that Grok can outperform ChatGPT. Grok is still under development, but Musk has said that he plans to release it to the public in the near future.

Odyssey Ai-One is a new golf putter has a built-in sensor that tracks the golfer's swing path and ball speed. This data is then used by the putter's AI to calculate the ideal clubface angle and loft for the putt. Odyssey claims that the Ai-One putter can help golfers improve their putting accuracy by up to 20%.

7-Eleven Japan is planning to use generative AI to speed up its production planning process. The company is currently developing an AI system that can automatically generate production plans based on historical sales data and other factors. 7-Eleven believes that this system could help it to reduce food waste and improve efficiency.

Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are pouring billions of dollars into cloud capacity in order to support the growing demand for AI computing power. These companies are building new data centers and expanding existing ones in order to meet the needs of AI researchers and businesses. 

Chinese Cambrian Intelligence has developed an AI analog chip that it claims is 3000 times faster than Nvidia's A100 GPU. The chip, called the M1, is designed specifically for AI workloads and is said to be much more efficient than traditional GPUs.

Cousins in global ai race. Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of AI chips. Wei is the CEO of TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry. The two cousins are competing to develop the most powerful and efficient AI chips, and their rivalry is shaping the future of AI.
