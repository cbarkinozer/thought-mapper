- Over half of employees have no idea how their companies are using AI. 

- Blockchain companies are creating AI chatbots to help developers.

- UK officials use AI to decide on issues from benefits to marriage licences.

- UN Asks Google, Microsoft to Help It Figure Out How Risky AI Is.

- Pigeons problem-solve similarly to artificial intelligence, research shows. 

- USA Today staffers fume as strange bylines on articles raise suspicions of AI-generated content.

- Google to invest another $2B in AI firm Anthropic: Report.

A recent survey by UKG found that over half of employees have no idea how their companies are using AI. This is despite the fact that the majority of C-suite leaders (78%) say that their company is using AI today.

Blockchain companies are developing AI chatbots that can help developers with a variety of tasks, such as writing code, debugging, and finding resources.

The UK's General Register Office is also using AI to process marriage licence applications. This helps to reduce the workload on staff and to make it easier for couples to get married.

The UN is concerned about the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, such as developing autonomous weapons or spreading disinformation.

The research found that pigeons are able to learn and adapt to new situations in a way that is similar to how AI algorithms learn. This suggests that pigeons may be able to be used to develop new AI algorithms that are more efficient and effective than existing algorithms.

USA Today staffers are fuming after a series of articles were published with strange bylines. The bylines were later revealed to be AI-generated, which has led to concerns about the use of AI to generate news content.

Google is reportedly planning to invest another $2 billion in AI firm Anthropic. Anthropic is a research lab that is developing AI systems that are safe and beneficial to humanity.
