Apple is reportedly planning to upgrade the App Store's search engine to make it more powerful and accurate. 

The upgrade to the App Store's search engine is expected to include a number of new features, such as the ability to search for apps by category, genre, and price.

OpenAI's Whisper can transcribe speech in real time with high accuracy, even in noisy environments.

Whisper is powered by a new AI model that is trained on a massive dataset of human speech. The model is able to learn the nuances of human speech and to distinguish between different speakers.

Apple has identified a few issues that can cause the iPhone 15 to overheat, including a bug in the iOS 17 software and the new titanium shells. 

Microsoft Copilot is a new AI assistant that is built into Windows 11.  Microsoft is hoping that Copilot will be more helpful and user-friendly than other AI assistants.

To stop Google Bard from storing your data and location, you can do the following: Go to the Google Bard website and log in to your account. Click on the "Settings" tab. Under the "Privacy" section, click on the "Manage your data" button. Click on the "Delete your activity" button. Under the "Delete by date range" section, select "All time." And click delete.
