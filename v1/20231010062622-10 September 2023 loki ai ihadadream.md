Some fans and critics have accused the show of using AI to cut corners and to create low-quality content. Disney has defended its use of generative AI, saying that it was used to create some background scenes in the show.

A new study has found that artificial intelligence can outperform the average human in a creative thinking test. The study found that AI was able to generate more creative ideas than humans on a variety of tasks.

A new article in the journal "Nature Machine Intelligence" explores the potential for generative AI to be used to create "jailbreaks" for large language models (LLMs).  The article argues that generative AI could be used to create jailbreaks for LLMs that would allow them to generate content that is not aligned with their training data. 

OpenAI is considering making its own AI chips in order to reduce its reliance on third-party chipmakers. Other tech companies, such as Google and Amazon, are also considering making their own AI chips.

Google has announced new generative AI search capabilities for doctors. These new capabilities will allow doctors to search for information using natural language queries, and generate summaries of medical records and other documents.

Saudi Arabia and China have agreed to work together to develop and manufacture AI chips. Some are concered that this collaboration might give an unfair advantage and lead to a shortage of AI chips.

A study found that AI was able to generate a design for a walking robot that was "small, squishy, and misshapen" and that spasmed.

A new study by DeepMind found that LLMs are often able to generate correct answers to reasoning tasks, but they are not able to correct themselves when they make mistakes.
