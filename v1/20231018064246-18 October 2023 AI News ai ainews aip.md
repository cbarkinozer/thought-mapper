- AI pioneers Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio clash in an intense online debate over AI safety and governance.

- Researchers Just Found Something Terrifying About Talking to AI Chatbots.

- AI Platform Alliance will drive AI to be more open, efficient and sustainable.

- AI Funding Soars to $17.9 Billion While Rest of Tech Slumps.

- Nvidia Boosts AI Performance With TensorRT.

Meta's chief AI scientist LeCun, argued that AI is not yet powerful enough to pose a serious threat to humanity and government regulation of AI is unnecessary and could stifle innovation. The founder of Element AI professor Bengio, countered that AI is already very powerful and that we need to take steps to ensure that it is used safely and ethically and government regulation is necessary to prevent AI from being used for malicious purposes.

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have found something terrifying about talking to AI chatbots: they can make you more susceptible to believing misinformation.

The AI Platform Alliance, a new industry alliance, has been launched to drive AI to be more open, efficient, and sustainable. The alliance includes members such as Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

The AI Platform Alliance will focus on promoting open source AI platforms and tools, develop more efficient AI algorithms and hardware, reduce the environmental impact of AI.

Venture capital funding for AI startups soared to $17.9 billion in the first half of 2023, even as the rest of the tech industry slumped. This is a sign that investors are still very bullish on AI.

Nvidia has launched TensorRT, a new software platform that boosts AI performance on Nvidia GPUs. TensorRT optimizes AI models for inference, which is the process of using AI models to make predictions on new data. TensorRT can improve AI performance by up to 20x.
