- It’s not luddism to rein it in.

- This AI Threat Summit Is a Doomer’s Paradise.Microsoft gains $70 billion and Alphabet loses more than twice as much as Satya Nadella steals Sundar Pichai’s thunder on AI.

AI can help marketers automate tasks, personalize experiences, gain insights, and make better decisions.

AI poses a number of risks in public policymaking. One risk is that AI could be used to make decisions that are biased or discriminatory. Another risk is that AI could be used to manipulate people's opinions or behavior.

IBM has developed a new chip that can speed up AI workloads by up to 10 times. The chip, called the Telum processor, is designed for use in data centers.

Professor Stuart Russell has warned that AI doomsday warnings are a distraction from the dangers that AI already poses. He says AI already harms people by spreading misinformation and manipulation.

AI could be used to develop new medical treatments, create more efficient transportation systems, and reduce poverty. However AI could also be used to develop autonomous weapons, create mass surveillance systems, and manipulate people's behavior.

The AI Threat Summit is a valuable forum for discussing the risks of AI and developing strategies to mitigate them. However, the summit has also been criticized for being too pessimistic and for not focusing on the potential benefits of AI.

Microsoft's stock price has increased by $70 billion in the past year, while Alphabet's stock price has decreased by more than twice as much. This is due in part to Microsoft's strong focus on AI.

Microsoft is investing heavily in AI research and development. The company has also developed a number of successful AI products, such as Azure AI and the HoloLens.

Alphabet, on the other hand, has been slower to embrace AI. The company has been criticized for its lack of focus on AI and for its failure to develop successful AI products.
