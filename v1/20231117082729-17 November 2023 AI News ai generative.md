- Google DeepMind wants to define what counts as artificial general intelligence.

- Microsoft announced a custom AI chip that could compete with Nvidia.

- Meta brings us a step closer to AI-generated movies.

- Google CEO Sundar Pichai compares AI to climate change at the APEC CEO Summit.

- AI will create ‘largest displacement of human labor in the history of capitalism,’ says tech-focused hedge fund CEO.

- The “Make It Real” AI prototype wows devs by turning drawings into working software.

Google DeepMind outlines five ascending levels of AGI: emerging (like ChatGPT and Bard), competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman (performing a wide range of tasks better than all humans, including tasks humans cannot do at all, such as decoding other people’s thoughts, predicting future events, and talking to animals). They note that no level beyond emerging AGI has been achieved.

Microsoft has announced a new custom AI chip called the Azure Inferentia. The chip is designed to be used to accelerate AI training and inference workloads. Microsoft claims that the Azure Inferentia is up to 20 times faster than comparable chips from Nvidia, the current leader in the AI chip market.

Meta, the company that owns Facebook, has announced a new AI-powered tool that can generate short video clips from text descriptions. The tool, called MAKE-A-VIDEO, is still in its early stages of development, but it is capable of producing surprisingly realistic and creative results. Meta is hoping that MAKE-A-VIDEO will eventually be used to create full-length movies.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that AI has the potential to be both a great benefit and a grave threat to humanity and that it is important to start thinking about how to regulate AI now.

Leon Cooperman, the CEO of Omega Advisors, a tech-focused hedge fund, has said that AI will create the "largest displacement of human labor in the history of capitalism." Cooperman believes that this displacement will be "very disruptive" and that it is important to start thinking about how to create new jobs for displaced workers.

A new AI prototype called "Make It Real" has wowed developers by turning drawings into working software. The prototype, which was developed by Google AI, can automatically convert simple drawings into code that can be used to create web applications or mobile apps.
