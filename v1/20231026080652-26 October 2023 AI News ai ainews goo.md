Google announced that it will require Android apps to better moderate AI-generated content starting in January 2024. 

Under the new policy, Android app developers will be required to:

    Implement features that allow users to report AI-generated content.
    Moderate AI-generated content in a timely manner.
    Provide clear and concise guidelines to users on what types of AI-generated content are prohibited.

In a recent interview, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he sees ChatGPT on track to transition from AI to AGI. 

Human compositional thinking is the ability to combine different concepts and ideas to create new ones.Researchers are trying to develop AI systems that can mimic human compositional thinking. 

Researchers have developed an AI system called "ListenForest" that can catalogue a forest's inhabitants simply by listening. The AI system,  uses machine learning to identify the sounds of different animals and plants.

Researchers at Google AI have developed a new AI system called "Woodpecker" that can help to solve the problem of hallucinations in AI systems. Woodpecker works by detecting hallucinations in AI systems and then correcting them. 

Amazon is now allowing advertisers to use generative AI to improve their product shots. This means that advertisers can now use AI to generate images of their products that are more visually appealing and informative.

The White House is expected to unveil a sweeping AI executive order next week. The executive order is expected to cover a wide range of topics, including AI ethics, AI research and development, and AI regulation.
