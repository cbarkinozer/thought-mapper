Responsiv is a legal tech startup that is developing AI tools to help in-house attorneys save time and money. Responsiv also offers a variety of other AI-powered tools, such as a contract review tool and a compliance tool. Responsiv recently raised $3 million in funding from Greylock, a leading venture capital firm. 

Meta recently announced that it is making its AI tools available for free to businesses. However, some companies have said that the cost of using Meta's AI tools is actually quite high. For example, one company said that it cost $100,000 to train a large language model on Meta's AI platform.

Generative AI has the potential to significantly improve the productivity of businesses by generating leads, write marketing copy, and develop new products. Managers can automate tasks, generate new ideas, and improve the quality of their work. 

Researchers have found that chatbots are very gullible and can be easily tricked by hackers. For example, researchers were able to trick chatbots into revealing confidential information and into performing malicious actions.

Elon Musk believes that AI will become so sophisticated that it will be able to do all of the jobs that are currently done by humans. We need to develop policies and programs to help people adjust to a world where AI is doing many of the jobs that are currently done by humans.

Microsoft has been using AI to replace staff in its news division. However, this has led to a number of problems, such as factually inaccurate articles and biased reporting.
