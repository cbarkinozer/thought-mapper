Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as images, text, and code. It is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many industries. As a result, there is a growing demand for workers who have the skills to use generative AI.

There are a number of ways to get started with on-the-job generative AI training. One way is to take online courses or tutorials. There are also a number of books and articles on the subject. Another way to get started is to experiment with generative AI tools and platforms. There are a number of free and low-cost tools available online.

Once you have a basic understanding of generative AI, you can start to apply it to your work. For example, you could use generative AI to create marketing materials, design products, or develop new business models.

Meta, the company that owns Facebook, has disbanded its Responsible AI team. The team was responsible for developing policies and guidelines for the development and use of AI at Meta.

The disbanding of the team has been criticized by some who believe that it will make it more difficult for Meta to develop responsible AI. However, Meta has defended the decision, saying that it will allow the company to be more agile and innovative in its use of AI.

Lores believes that AI will make PCs more powerful and versatile, and that this will lead to increased demand. 

OpenAI is making ChatGPT Voice available for free in order to encourage its adoption and to get feedback from the community. The company is hoping that ChatGPT Voice will be used to create a wide range of new applications, such as audiobooks, podcasts, and educational materials.
