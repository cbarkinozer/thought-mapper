University of Turin in Italy have used AI to read a word on an ancient scroll that was burned by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.  The researchers used a technique called X-ray phase-contrast tomography to create a 3D image of the scroll. 

Microsoft has launched a new bug bounty program that is designed to find and fix security vulnerabilities in Bing, and it offers rewards of up to $100,000 for the most critical vulnerabilities.

The Pentagon's AI program "GAMECHANGER" has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. 

University of California Berkeley have developed a more energy-efficient transistor. This could lead to the development of smartwatches that can use better AI.

Microsoft is developing a new feature for Outlook that will allow the email client to write emails for you. The feature is still under development, but it is expected to be released in the near future.

The new feature will use AI to analyze your past emails and writing style. It will then use this information to generate new emails for you. This could save you a lot of time, especially if you send a lot of emails throughout the day.

University of Tübingen Germany have developed a new AI-generation technique that can create hypnotic optical art. Experts are concerned of nefarious subliminal messages in images however, the researchers are working on ways to prevent this from happening.

Elon Musk has unveiled a new AI company called X.ai, a platform will help investors to make better investment decisions by analyzing a wide variety of data, including financial data, news, and social media data and use this information to generate recommendations for investors.
