Roboticists are excited about the potential of generative AI to revolutionize the field of robotics. Generative AI can be used to design and develop new robots, as well as to train robots to perform new tasks.

AI assistants are being positioned for everyday work and school life in a number of ways. 

Google has announced new generative AI search capabilities for doctors. These new capabilities will allow doctors to search for medical information in a more efficient and effective way.

University of California, Berkeley have begun building AI for scientific discovery using the technology behind ChatGPT. The scientists are hoping to use AI to automate the process of scientific discovery to identify new hypotheses, design experiments, and analyze data.

A recent study by the World Economic Forum suggests that the rapid pace of technological change is making it difficult for people to keep up with the skills they need to be successful in the workforce and half of all skills will be outdated within two years.

China is investing heavily in AI, and this investment is paying off. Chinese AI cities are showing how hi-tech is improving lives. Chinese AI cities are using AI to improve traffic flow, reduce crime, and provide better healthcare services. AI is also being used to create new jobs and to boost the economy.

Researchers at MIT have developed a new generative AI model that outperforms diffusion models in image generation. The new model, called Imagen, is able to generate images that are more realistic and detailed than images generated by diffusion models. Imagen could be used to create new video games and movies. Imagen could also be used to develop new medical imaging tools.
