- Scams targeting older Americans, most using AI, caused over $1 billion in losses in 2022.

- The US government banned Nvidia's fastest gaming GPU from China â€” chipmaker pulls RTX 4090 listings due to AI concerns, but leaves RTX 6000 Ada.

- Google is embedding inaudible watermarks right into its AI generated music.

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new 3D printer that can use cameras and AI to monitor its own printing process and make adjustments in real time. This could lead to the development of more reliable and efficient 3D printers.

Google has developed a new AI tool that can generate product descriptions based on user-generated text prompts. This could make it easier for shoppers to find the products they are looking for and for businesses to market their products more effectively.

A new report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that scams targeting older Americans caused over $1 billion in losses in 2022. The report found that the vast majority of these scams were using AI to generate fake text messages, phone calls, and emails.
