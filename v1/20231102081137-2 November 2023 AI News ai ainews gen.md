Apple is investing in AI, but deploying it more deliberately than its rivals. This is likely due to its focus on quality and privacy.

Microsoft has launched a new AI-powered Office assistant called Viva Engage to help people to stay connected and engaged with their work and with their colleagues. Viva Engage can be used to create and share personalized content, to start and participate in conversations, and to get help with tasks.

Viva Engage is currently only available to a limited number of users, and it costs $9,000 per year. Microsoft plans to make Viva Engage more widely available in the future, and it is expected to be included in Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

Super Micro Computer, a maker of data center servers, has beat estimates on AI infrastructure demand. This is a sign that the demand for AI infrastructure is continuing to grow.

The growing demand for AI infrastructure is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing adoption of AI in the enterprise and the growing popularity of cloud-based AI services.

Chinese scientists have developed a chip that can perform an AI task 3,000 times faster than Nvidia's A100 chip. The chip is called the Wukong 900, and it is designed to be used for machine learning and deep learning tasks.
