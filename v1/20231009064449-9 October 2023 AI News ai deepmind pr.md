China is planning a big AI and computing buildup, which is expected to benefit local firms. The Chinese government has set a goal to become a global leader in AI by 2030.

The Chinese government is investing heavily in AI research and development. The government is also providing tax breaks and other incentives to AI companies.

The Chinese government's support for AI is expected to boost the growth of the AI industry in China. The Chinese AI industry is expected to grow by 25% annually over the next five years.

The growth of the Chinese AI industry is expected to benefit local Chinese AI firms. Chinese AI firms are expected to gain a larger share of the global AI market.

Google DeepMind Researchers Introduce Promptbreeder: A Self-Referential and Self-Improving AI System that can Automatically Evolve Effective Domain-Specific Prompts in a Given Domain

Promptbreeder is a new AI system developed by researchers at Google DeepMind. Promptbreeder is a self-referential and self-improving AI system that can automatically evolve effective domain-specific prompts in a given domain.

Promptbreeder works by generating and evaluating a large number of prompts. Promptbreeder then selects the most effective prompts and uses them to generate new prompts. This process is repeated until Promptbreeder is able to generate prompts that are tailored to a specific domain.

Promptbreeder is a promising new AI system that has the potential to improve the performance of AI models in a variety of domains.

There is a new AI device that could replace smartphones.

A new AI device called the "Neuralink" is being developed by Elon Musk's company, Neuralink. The Neuralink is a brain-computer interface (BCI) that is implanted in the brain. The Neuralink is designed to allow users to communicate with computers and other devices using their minds.

The Neuralink is still in development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. The Neuralink could be used to control computers, smartphones, and other devices with our minds. The Neuralink could also be used to improve cognitive function and to treat medical conditions.

Microsoft CEO Nadella blasts Google, shares his big AI fear.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has blasted Google for its dominance in the search market. Nadella has also expressed concerns about the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes.

Nadella has said that Google's dominance in the search market is stifling competition and innovation. Nadella has also said that Google is using its dominance in the search market to collect data on users without their consent.

Nadella has also expressed concerns about the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes. Nadella has said that AI could be used to create deepfakes and to spread misinformation. Nadella has also said that AI could be used to develop autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention.

The AI gadgets are coming.

A new generation of AI gadgets is coming to market. These gadgets are designed to be more intelligent and more helpful than traditional gadgets.

Some examples of AI gadgets include:

    Smart speakers that can understand and respond to natural language
    Smart home devices that can learn our routines and preferences
    Wearable devices that can track our health and fitness data
    AI-powered assistants that can help us with tasks such as scheduling appointments and booking travel

AI gadgets have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. AI gadgets can make our lives easier and more efficient. AI gadgets can also help us to stay healthy and fit.
